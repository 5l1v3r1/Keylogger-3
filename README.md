# Keylogger
Keylogger built in C# .NET for Win 7/8/8.1/10

## About/Description
This is a project that was originally hosted on my Pastebin page.
I've updated the code and created a new GitHub repo for this project.

**The code uses the .NET Framwork v4.5.2**

## Disclaimer
This code was designed to capture/intercept all of a target/victim's keystroke data,
write all content to a document, then update that code on an FTP server ever so often.
I don't accept any responsibility for any abuse to my code. You do with it what you
please, but I do not condone/endorse any illicit/illegal activity.

## Updates
### v1.0:
-- Information Gathering Payload included.
-- Updates every 5 minutes (configurable)

## Support
I noticed my code is rather sloppy and hard to read. If you (the commmunity)
update any code for faster, and more simple code, please don't hesitate to
fork my project. I'd be glad to see this advance. Thanks in advance :)
